      <h2 class="topic-header">What is Freedom?</h2>
      <p class="paragraph-content">
        Defining American freedom involves a comparison between the nation's
        written values and the experiences of the various peoples living in the
        United States over time. The Declaration of Independence is among the
        most commonly referenced documents for this purpose. Specifically, the
        ideology of the "self-evident" truth that "all men are created equal"
        facilitates the development of a highly ambitious proposal of freedom
        for those in the U.S., both past and present. However, American history
        oftentimes exemplifies a contradiction to these values, and
        non-discriminatory freedom has seldom been consistent, especially during
        the Gilded Age.

      <h2 class="topic-header">Freedom in the Gilded Age</h2>
      <p class="paragraph-content">
        The Gilded Age pushed one of the greatest negative impacts on the
        freedom of the people living in the United States. With the rise of
        corruption in the economic and political sectors of society, the
        protection of civil liberties and equality was oftentimes highly limited
        for subordinate groups. Not only so, but even those liberties which were
        explictily outlined in laws were molded by twisted interpretations at
        the hands of those with power.

        The Freedom of the Working Class and the Growth of Big Businesses
      </h3>
      <p class="subtopic-paragraph-content">
        The working class was exposed to inequality mostly due to the influence
        of ideologies favorable towards dominant groups in society.
        Specifically, the establishment of laissez-faire capitalism and Social
        Darwinism as societal norms facilitated a largely unrestrained growth of
        businesses that limited the freedom of the working class. With owners
        like J.P Morgan and Andrew Carnegie roaming freely during the age, a
        strong opposition towards labor unions and worker's civil liberties was
        almost always a given in normal businesse procedures. One of the most
        brutal consequences of such inequality was the Great Railroad Strike of
        1877, a nationwide opposition to the unfair wages and working conditions
        of railroad companies. In it, a large group of workers protested against
        the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company in Martinsburg, West Virginia.
        They specifically fought against unfavorable pay cuts by sabotaging
        railroad processes, and were eventually met with considerable force by
        federal troops after militia units proved ineffective. Similarly, during
        the Homestead Strike of 1892 at Andrew Carnegie's steel mill in
        Pennsylvania, workers were locked inside of the steelworks by
        strikebreaker units in opposition to labor protests against low wages
        and the restriction of unions. The problematic nature of these events
        proved that a "glass ceiling" of freedom existed for those participating
        in hard labor. The events also proved that large businesses oftentimes
        profited at the expense of subordinate groups. As a result of this,
        companies such as U.S. Steel and Rockefeller's Standard Oil ammassed
        billions and millions, respectively, in capital throughout the age.
