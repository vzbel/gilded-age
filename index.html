    <p class="paragraph-content">
      Defining American freedom involves a comparison between the nation's
      written values and the experiences of the various peoples living in the
      United States over time. The Declaration of Independence is among the most
      commonly referenced documents for this purpose. Specifically, the ideology
      of the "self-evident" truth that "all men are created equal" facilitates
      the development of a highly ambitious proposal of freedom for those in the
      U.S., both past and present. However, American history oftentimes
      exemplifies a contradiction to these values, and non-discriminatory
      freedom has seldom been consistent, especially during the Gilded Age.
